This Thursday, July 14th at 12:30pm, Vermeer will deliver our
[PTX 40 vibratory plow](/equipment/ptx40). A product specialist will be on
hand for demo and familiarization. If you're planning to rent the plow
and crew it yourself, this will be a perfect opportunity to ask questions.

We can train other crew later, but you won't be learning from the master. :)

For more information, and to find where on the Peninsula the demo will
be, please [contact us](mailto:info@southbranch.net).
