A vibratory plow is the most cost-effective way to install underground
fiber *when there are no obstructions at the surface* and when the
soil type is compatible.

The PTX40 has a plow on the back and a chain trencher (4" width, 36"
depth) on the front. Two blades are available: a pull blade with 1
1/2" bullet, and a chute blade with 1" i.d. Both blades are serrated
and have presets for 18", 21", and 24" depth. The chute blade can
place warning tape 6" above the product.

For an extra deposit we'll send along the Porta-Bore non-directional
drill tooling. Porta-Bore is non-directional like a missile bore
("point and pray") but is quicker to set up, uses a smaller sending
pit, and installs product on the pullback just like a real drill. Our
tooling can support up to 30 foot bores of product up to 2" o.d.

Our Vermeer PTX40 was delivered to us from the factory in 2022 and is
equipped with Quad-Track tracks for minimum surface disturbance and
maximum traction.

44" wide and 96" long, the PTX40 fits almost anywhere you need to go.
